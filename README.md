# Youtube_comments_spam_detection
This project deals with the spam detection of youtube video comments using Machine learning algorithms . The project primarily uses SVM model for the detection of spam.
YouTube is one of the most popular video-sharing platforms, allowing users to engage with content creators through comments. However, this open environment has also led to the proliferation of spam comments, which can include misleading links, advertisements, or malicious content. These spam comments not only degrade the user experience but also pose significant security risks by directing users to phishing sites or malware-infected pages. The increasing volume of spam comments necessitates an effective detection mechanism to filter out such content and maintain the integrity of online discussions.

To address this issue, we propose a machine learning-based approach that leverages Support Vector Machine (SVM) for spam detection. Unlike traditional filtering methods that rely on keyword matching, SVM is capable of learning complex patterns in text data, making it highly effective for classification tasks. By preprocessing the comment data, extracting relevant features, and applying SVM, we can significantly improve the accuracy of spam detection. This approach enhances YouTube’s existing moderation tools by providing a more intelligent and automated method to identify and remove spam comments.        

In addition, this project examines how SVM compares with other classification models such as Naïve Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), and neural networks. While Naïve Bayes is effective for probabilistic classification, it struggles with complex feature interactions. KNN, although simple, becomes computationally expensive for large datasets, while deep learning models, such as neural networks, require extensive computational power. SVM stands out as a balance between accuracy and efficiency, making it an ideal choice for text-based classification tasks like spam detection. The model is further fine-tuned through hyperparameter optimization to enhance performance.
